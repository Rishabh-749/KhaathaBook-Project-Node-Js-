# üìí KhaataBook Mini Project

> A digital credit-debit ledger system built with Node.js, Express, and EJS ‚Äî inspired by traditional Indian bookkeeping practices (`‡§π‡§ø‡§∏‡§æ‡§¨ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§§‡§æ‡§¨`). Designed for small businesses, shopkeepers, and individuals to maintain simple financial records.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This mini-project is a simplified digital version of a **personal ledger book**. Users can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) financial records. Each entry is stored as a separate text file on the server, and the frontend is rendered using EJS templates. The project is designed to be minimal yet functional for small-scale use cases like personal finance tracking or micro business accounts.
